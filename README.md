## What is this connector?

If you are familiar with Azure Logic App, you must've used the designer view to create your own Orchestrations. To create it you will be using an Action. An action or otherwise known as connector, e.g. Facebook, Outlook, Twitter etc.. To enable users to track data from their Business Logic into ServerLess360 BAM we provide this connector. Know more about how to leverage it in your applications here --> [Documentation!](https://docs.serverless360.com)

## Important Points to be Noted

- If you are deploying the connector to Subscription "Test", the connector will be available only inside the Subscription "Test"

- This is just a temporary way of deploying the connectors until we get it published in Azure Marketplace.
