> Click the below button to deploy the custom connector

## Important Points to be Noted

- If you are deploying the connector to Subscription "Test", the connector will be available only inside the Subscription "Test"
- If you have deployed the connector in Region "Central US", the logic Apps which needs the connector to be used should also be in the same region.
- This is just a temporary way of deploying the connectors until we get it published in Azure Marketplace.
